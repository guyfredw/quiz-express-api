## Planning story

Building the backend was a considerably new step, that I wasn't used to before. But after many days of learning it was time to start a project of a full-stack application. In order to tackle this project I used different tools such as express.js, mongoose and mongoDB to help build my backend. By building the models, and then the routes, it was possible to determine how the client would communicate with the api and how that data would be stored. To avoid any errors, it was crucial to test the project using curl-scripts. After building the backend it was time to start building the client and how it would interact with the database.
